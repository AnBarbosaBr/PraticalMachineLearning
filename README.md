# Pratical Machine Learning

This repository was created as part of the course [Pratical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning/home/welcome), from John Hopkins, hosted on Coursera.

Here I will analyse **Human Activity Recognition** data, collected from on-body sensors (like  *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit*) on six different participants when making weight lifting exercises, correctly and incorrectly. 

The original dataset is available at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises, as part of the work of [Vellloso et al](#References).

In this study I used only the data made available in the course, downloaded usign the script "R/000_download_data.R"

The final report will be available as a GitHub page, but I will also keep the intermediary steps and analysis available in R Markdown notebooks at the Analysis folder.
